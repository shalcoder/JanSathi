# JanSathi AI: Sovereign Citizen Agent — Official Submission

---

### 1️⃣ Basic Details (Page 1)
*   **Team Name**: Team JanSathi (Elite AI Labs)
*   **Team Leader Name**: Vishal
*   **Problem Statement**: 
    Despite ₹18 Lakh Crore in annual government subsidies, rural citizens in India face a **40% friction loss** due to language barriers, technical complexity, and missing documentation. Existing solutions are passive chatbots that fail to address the **emotional and visual** needs of the most vulnerable.

---

### 2️⃣ Brief About the Idea (Page 2)
**JanSathi v4.0** is an "Extraordinary Sovereign Citizen Agent" that transforms the complex bureaucracy of India into a simple, empathetic, and visual conversation. 
Using **AWS Bedrock (Claude 3.5 Sonnet)**, we have built a system that doesn't just answer questions; it **audits rights**. It combines multi-dialect voice (22+ languages) with visual document intelligence (Kagaz Auditor Pro) to ensure no citizen is left behind.

### 3️⃣ Core Justification & USP (Page 3)
*   **Evaluation Metric: INNOVATION**: 
    While others build "Chatbots", we built a **Sentiment-Aware Agent**. 
    1.  **Aastha Voice**: First-of-its-kind emotional prioritization.
    2.  **Kagaz Auditor Pro**: Switches from simple OCR to **Eligibility Risk Assessment**.
*   **USP**: 
    > **"The only AI system in India that Proactively Matches Agricultural Crops to Government Subsidies & Buyers in Real-Time (Livelihood Connector)."**
