# 1-Minute Technical Pitch Narration

**Speaker:** Technical Lead / Architect
**Audience:** Judges & Investors

**(0:00 - 0:10) The Hook**
"Judges, we built JanSathi to solve a simple but brutal problem: **Information exists, but access is broken.** A farmer shouldn't need a PhD to know wheat prices. They just need to *ask*."

**(0:10 - 0:25) The Architecture**
"Under the hood, JanSathi is a **serverless, event-driven fortress**. We don't process logic on the phone. The app is just a thin client. All the heavy lifting happens on AWS. API Gateway ingests the voice, Lambda orchestrates the flow. It's statutory, scalable, and costs near-zero when idle."

**(0:25 - 0:40) The Intelligence (The 'Magic')**
"Here is the differentiator: We built an **Anti-Hallucination RAG Layer**. We use Amazon Transcribe to capture the dialect, but before the LLM speaks, we ground it with Amazon Kendra. The LLM (Bedrock) is *only* allowed to summarize facts we retrieve. It cannot invent prices. It cannot invent schemes."

**(0:40 - 0:50) Reliability**
"We designed for the **'Zero-Bar' reality** of rural India. If the internet fails, we have a cached offline layer with the top 50 civic answers stored right on the device. No data? No problem. We fall back to SMS."

**(0:50 - 1:00) The Close**
"JanSathi isn't just a chatbot. It is a **multilingual reasoning engine** that turns public data into public *power*. Thank you."
